# Optimal Cricket Team Selection

This project leverages machine learning to optimize cricket team selection based on player performance data. Using an SVM (Support Vector Machine) model, the project achieved an accuracy of 85%, providing a reliable method for selecting the best team lineup.

## Features
- Analyzes player statistics to optimize team composition.
- Implements an SVM model for decision-making.
- Achieves high accuracy with minimal computational overhead.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains player performance datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Saved machine learning models for future use.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data cleaning and visualization.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
